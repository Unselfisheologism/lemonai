Mobile LemonAI Development Plan

Phase 1: Mobile Architecture Foundation
WebView Implementation

Create a mobile app with WebView as the primary browsing component
Implement session cookie access through Android's CookieManager
Set up communication bridge between WebView and native app
Mobile UI Implementation

Implement the swipe-up popup interface from UI-description.md
Create mobile-optimized chat interface
Add browser-like tab system with previews
Implement slash commands (/search, /ask, /automate, /expert)

Phase 2: Core AI Integration
Puter.js Integration

Replace external API key dependencies with puter.js for AI features
Implement perplexity sonar models for web search functionality
Set up intercommunication between AI model and sonar models
WASM Sandbox Implementation

Replace Docker-based code execution with WASM
Implement JavaScript and Python execution in WASM
Ensure security and isolation for user code execution

Phase 3: Workflow and Automation
n8n Integration

Integrate n8n as npm package (7MB as mentioned)
Create mobile-optimized UI for n8n
Implement hidden UI mode where AI agent controls workflows
Add manual control option in settings for technical users
Session Cookie Integration

Implement extraction of session cookies from WebView
Pass credentials to the node of n8n which handles the integration to the specific external tool ( for external tool integration )
Handle authentication flows without requiring active tabs ( refer to @/answers.md )

Phase 4: Android Automation
FULLY-Blurr-based Accessibility Service ( **completely based on the blurr repo located @/blurr-repo.md ( yes, the entire blurr repo is located in this md file.)** )

Implement Android accessibility service for UI automation
Create Google-assistant-like home-button activation
Give ability to the AI agent to touch UI elements and view phone screen
Implement task automation and scheduling based on user commands

External Tool Integration

Use n8n + session cookies for tools with API support
Use Blurr accessibility service for tools without API support
Implement fallback mechanisms for manual task performance

Phase 5: Advanced Features
Workflow Builder

Create simplified workflow interface optimized for mobile
Implement vertical node arrangement for mobile UX
Add ability for AI agent to create, read, update, delete, schedule, and execute workflows
Final Integration and Polish

Connect all components together
Implement the canvas feature for multimodal content
Add video player with editing capabilities
Complete the mobile UI based on the wireframes in UI-description.md



This plan shifts from the current desktop-focused Docker-based architecture to your desired mobile-first implementation with WebView, puter.js integration, n8n workflows, and Android accessibility services. Each phase builds upon the previous one to create a complete mobile AI agent that meets all the requirements outlined in your desire.md file.
