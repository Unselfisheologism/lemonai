# LemonAI Mobile Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation progress of the LemonAI mobile application based on the requirements from `desire.md`, `UI-description.md`, and `answers.md`.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Architecture
- ✅ **Mobile-first architecture** with WebView as primary browsing component
- ✅ **Session cookie access** through Android's CookieManager
- ✅ **Communication bridge** between WebView and native app
- ✅ **Component connector** to integrate all subsystems

### 2. UI Components
- ✅ **Swipe-up popup interface** as described in UI-description.md
- ✅ **Mobile-optimized chat interface** with user identification and AI response areas
- ✅ **Browser-like tab system** with previews and vertical arrangement
- ✅ **Slash commands** (/search, /ask, /automate, /expert)
- ✅ **Canvas feature** for multimodal content (images, video, charts, etc.)
- ✅ **Video player with editing capabilities**

### 3. AI Integration
- ✅ **Puter.js integration** for AI features (replacing external API keys)
- ✅ **WASM sandbox** for secure code execution (replacing Docker)
- ✅ **Perplexity Sonar models** integration for web search functionality

### 4. Workflow Automation
- ✅ **n8n integration** as npm package
- ✅ **Mobile workflow builder** with vertical node arrangement
- ✅ **Hidden UI mode** where AI agent controls workflows
- ✅ **Manual control option** in settings for technical users

### 5. External Tool Integration
- ✅ **Session cookie extraction** from WebView
- ✅ **Credential management** for n8n nodes
- ✅ **Authentication flows** without requiring active tabs

### 6. Android-Specific Features
- ✅ **Accessibility service** for UI automation (based on Blurr)
- ✅ **Google-assistant-like home-button activation**
- ✅ **Ability for AI agent to touch UI elements and view phone screen**
