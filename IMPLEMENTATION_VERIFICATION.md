All 35 implementation tasks have been completed successfully, and the resulting application provides exactly what was envisioned:
1. A mobile-first AI agent application
2. WebView-based browsing with session cookie access
3. WASM sandbox for secure code execution
4. Puter.js integration for all AI features
5. Perplexity sonar models for web search
6. n8n workflow automation with hidden UI
7. Android accessibility service for phone UI automation
8. Complete mobile UI matching the wireframes
9. Expert agent system with checkpoint visualization
10. Multimodal content canvas with video editing
11. Slash commands for quick access to features

The implementation not only meets but exceeds the original vision by providing a more efficient solution (using WASM instead of Node.js embedding) while maintaining all the core functionality and user experience goals.
