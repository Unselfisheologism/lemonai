question 1: is this possible on an agentic mobile browser (though it doesnt exist)

 
Yes, it is entirely possible for a hypothetical agentic mobile browser to use session cookies without the corresponding tab being open
. This is because cookies are handled at the browser's application level, not the tab level, and mobile browser architecture supports this. 
 
How it would work on a mobile device
A mobile version of would follow the same logic, operating within the browser's overall session, not within individual tabs.
1.	Session-level storage: On Android, browsers like Chrome store cookies in a local storage database (historically SQLite). On iOS, the WKWebView component, used by many browser apps, manages persistent cookie storage separately from the user interface.
2.	AI agent access: The agentic AI features, operating within the browser application itself, would have permission to access the mobile browser's cookie storage. When a user gives a command, the agent can retrieve the necessary cookies from this central store to perform its task.
3.	Authentication flows: The AI agent would not need to open a visible tab to use a session cookie. For example, if you ask the agent to track a package, it could: 
o	Find the relevant e-commerce website domain.
o	Access the stored session cookie for that domain.
o	Open a new, temporary background web process to access the server and perform the tracking.
o	Return the results to the user without ever showing a new tab on the screen.
4.	Security considerations: This approach requires robust security measures, as the agent would have access to all your cookies. A key feature of agentic browsers is their "on-device" processing, which ensures sensitive data like cookies do not leave your device and get sent to a third-party AI server. 
 
Architectural parallels on mobile
This concept is not new in the mobile world, and several architectural patterns support it:
•	Persistent cookies: Many mobile apps maintain your logged-in status using persistent cookies or tokens stored on the device, even when the app is closed.
•	Headless browsing for automation: As discussed in the Appium context, programmatic control of web browsers without a visible interface is a standard practice in development. A mobile agentic browser would leverage similar principles to perform actions invisibly to the user.
•	Mobile OS architecture: Both iOS and Android are designed to allow applications to perform background tasks. A mobile agentic browser could use this functionality to execute web tasks when the user is not actively interacting with a webpage.

question 2: how to compile npm packages (mcp server) with my mobile app (so that the mcp server is locally hosted)
29 minutes ago

Running a Node.js server inside a mobile app is not a standard process, but it can be achieved by embedding the Node.js runtime. Instead of "compiling" the npm package, you embed a Node.js engine and run the server code within the app itself. The process differs for native apps (Swift/Kotlin) and cross-platform frameworks (React Native). 
The following guide details how to bundle an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server into a mobile application.
Method 1: Using the Node.js for Mobile Apps library (React Native)
This approach uses nodejs-mobile-react-native to run a Node.js engine on a separate background thread inside a React Native app. This is the most direct way to run an npm-based server locally within your mobile app. 
Set up your development environment. Ensure you have Node.js, npm, React Native, and the Android SDK/Xcode installed.
Create your Node.js server. Develop your MCP server code in a separate directory and confirm it runs correctly with node server.js on your development machine.
Install the Node.js Mobile library. In your React Native project, install the library and create a new folder for your Node.js server files.
sh
npm install nodejs-mobile-react-native --save
mkdir nodejs-project
Use code with caution.

Copy and bundle the server. Copy your MCP server's code, including the package.json and node_modules folder, into the newly created nodejs-project folder. Then, bundle the project.
sh
# From your React Native project root
npx nodejs-mobile-react-native bundle nodejs-project
Use code with caution.

Start the Node.js engine. In your React Native application code (e.g., App.js), import nodejs-mobile-react-native and start the Node.js process. You can pass arguments to control your server.
javascript
import nodejs from 'nodejs-mobile-react-native';

nodejs.start('main.js'); // Assuming your server entry point is main.js
Use code with caution.

Communicate with the server. You can use event listeners to send and receive messages between your React Native app and the Node.js server thread.
javascript
nodejs.channel.addListener(
  'message',
  (msg) => {
    // Handle message from Node.js
  },
  this
);
nodejs.channel.send('A message to the Node.js server.');
Use code with caution.

Build your mobile app. Use the standard React Native CLI commands to build your project for Android or iOS.
sh
npm run android
# or
npm run ios
Use code with caution.

Key considerations
Performance: Embedding a Node.js runtime will increase your app's size and resource usage compared to accessing a remote server. For heavy computation, you might encounter bottlenecks.
Permissions: You may need to add specific permissions in your mobile app's manifest (like android.permission.INTERNET) for network access.
Security: Accessing a server via http://localhost is fine for local use, but you must use HTTPS for any production scenarios to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
Build configurations: The final app bundle may need specific configurations in your mobile project (e.g., in app/build.gradle for Android) to handle the embedded native Node.js library. 

============================================================================================================

 question 3: how mych will method 1 increase tje build size by
19 minutes ago

Embedding a Node.js runtime with nodejs-mobile-react-native (Method 1) can increase your mobile app's build size by 10 to 50 MB or more, but the exact amount depends on several factors. This increase comes from including the Node.js binary and your server's dependencies directly in the app bundle. 
Here is a breakdown of what influences the final size:
1. The Node.js binary
The core Node.js binary is a significant part of the size increase. For example, GitHub issue logs show that upgrading to a newer React Native version (0.74.0) with an updated Node.js binary led to a substantial increase in APK size, jumping from 20.6 MB to 50.6 MB in a test build. 
2. The node_modules folder
The server's dependencies are typically the largest contributor to the final size. A small project with few dependencies might only add 10 to 20 MB, but a server with many heavy packages, like complex utility libraries or databases, can easily add several hundred megabytes to the bundle. 
3. Build optimizations
Mobile app stores use build optimization strategies to reduce the download size for end-users. 
Android App Bundles (AAB): When you upload an AAB to the Google Play Store, it automatically creates optimized APKs for different device architectures and languages. This can reduce the user's download size by 40% to 70% compared to the universal APK.
CPU architecture splits: You can configure your build process to create a separate APK for each CPU architecture (e.g., armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a). This prevents the final APK from including unnecessary code for other architectures, significantly reducing its size. 
4. Other project assets
The total size also includes other assets like fonts, images, and videos. These assets can also bloat the app if they are not compressed or optimized. 
Summary
The final build size increase depends on the Node.js version, your server's dependencies, and your app's optimization settings.
Without optimization: You can expect a noticeable increase of tens of megabytes just for the Node.js runtime and your server code.
With optimization: If you use app bundles and create builds for specific CPU architectures, the final download size for users will be much smaller than the initial, unoptimized build file.

question 4 (compiling questions 1, 2 and 3 and their respective answers) :
can i build an agentic mobile browser that connects to external tools like opera neon browser opera neon connects to external tools and performs actions on the user's behalf, by this following method: mentioned below. and then use those saved credentials to pass the credentials to a locally hosted n8n as shown in the attached screenshot? ( yes n8n is a part of my mobile app)


answer: It is possible to develop a hypothetical agentic mobile browser that would function similarly to the description provided, using session cookies to perform actions on a user's behalf without an active browser tab. Agentic AI transforms mobile applications from passive tools to intelligent partners that can make autonomous decisions. The concept of agentic browsers, which use AI to navigate websites and complete tasks, is an emerging field with companies like Perplexity and Fellou pioneering new solutions. 
The ability to pass credentials, such as session cookies, from an agentic browser to a locally hosted n8n instance within a mobile app would depend on the architecture of the browser and the n8n implementation. n8n credentials are used for connecting workflows to external services and are typically created and managed within the n8n application itself. While it is possible to programmatically pass credentials into an n8n workflow, this would likely require an API key or an OAuth flow, not a direct transfer of a session cookie. The technical challenge would be creating a secure and reliable method for the agentic browser to export the session data in a format that the n8n instance can use to authenticate with the external service. 
The search results indicate that self-hosting n8n is possible on a personal machine using methods like npm or Docker, but do not provide specific details on hosting n8n on a mobile device's operating system. The screenshot provided illustrates a workflow configuration within n8n, but the text query explores a hypothetical scenario of an agentic mobile browser. 

==============================================

so my plan is to 
1. make the ui of n8n, mobile-optimized. 
2. publish this mobile-optimized version as an npm package (the original n8n is already an npm package)
3. compile this n8n in my mobile app using nodejs-mobile. (question 2 and 3)
4. let the agent communicate and pass integration-specific credentials from the session cookies to the integrations like gmail, notion, etc. present on the  hosted-on-user's-device n8n instance to have (question 1 and 4)
5. modify n8n such that all the routing of the AI API Calls would be sent to the lemonai ai agent (this general ai agent) which uses puter.js for the AI features, thereby avoiding the need for AI APIs, even in the workflows.
