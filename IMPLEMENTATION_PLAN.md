- [x] Set up intercommunication between AI model and sonar models

### 2.2 WASM Sandbox
- [x] Replace Docker-based code execution with WASM
- [x] Implement JavaScript and Python execution in WASM
- [x] Ensure security and isolation for user code execution

## Phase 3: Workflow Automation

### 3.1 n8n Integration
- [x] Integrate n8n as npm package
- [x] Create mobile-optimized UI for n8n
- [x] Implement hidden UI mode where AI agent controls workflows
- [x] Add manual control option in settings for technical users

### 3.2 Credential Management
- [x] Implement extraction of session cookies from WebView
- [x] Pass credentials to n8n nodes for external tool integration
- [x] Handle authentication flows without requiring active tabs

## Phase 4: Android-Specific Features

### 4.1 Accessibility Service
- [x] Implement Android accessibility service for UI automation (based on Blurr)
- [x] Create Google-assistant-like home-button activation
- [x] Give ability to AI agent to touch UI elements and view phone screen

### 4.2 Advanced Features
- [x] Implement task automation and scheduling based on user commands
- [x] Use n8n + session cookies for tools with API support
- [x] Use Blurr accessibility service for tools without API support
- [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for manual task performance

## Phase 5: Mobile UX Optimization

### 5.1 Workflow Interface
- [x] Create simplified workflow interface optimized for mobile
- [x] Implement vertical node arrangement for mobile UX
- [x] Add ability for AI agent to create, read, update, delete, schedule, and execute workflows

### 5.2 Content Features
- [x] Implement canvas feature for multimodal content
- [x] Add video player with editing capabilities
- [x] Complete mobile UI based on wireframes in UI-description.md

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

- [ ] Improve WASM sandbox execution speed
- [ ] Enhance UI responsiveness
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint

### 6.3 Security Audit
- [ ] Conduct security review of credential management
- [ ] Verify isolation of user code execution
- [ ] Review communication protocols between components
- [ ] Ensure compliance with Android security guidelines

### 6.4 User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Conduct usability testing with target users
- [ ] Gather feedback on UI/UX
- [ ] Validate feature completeness
- [ ] Address any identified issues

## Phase 7: Documentation and Release

### 7.1 Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Develop developer documentation
- [ ] Prepare API documentation
- [ ] Write deployment guides

### 7.2 Release Preparation
- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Create installation packages
- [ ] Set up distribution channels
- [ ] Plan marketing and outreach

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Kotlin (Android development)
- WebView (browsing component)
- Material Design Components
- RecyclerView and CardView for UI

### Backend
- Puter.js (AI features)
- WASM (secure code execution)
- n8n (workflow automation)
- Android Accessibility Service (UI automation)

### Security
- Encrypted credential storage
- Secure inter-component communication
- Isolated execution environment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **WebView Performance**: Monitor and optimize WebView rendering performance
2. **WASM Compatibility**: Ensure WASM modules work across different Android versions
3. **Accessibility Service Limitations**: Test thoroughly on various Android devices
4. **n8n Integration Stability**: Validate integration with different n8n versions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Regular performance benchmarking
2. Comprehensive compatibility testing
3. Fallback mechanisms for critical features
4. Continuous integration and testing pipeline

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Application startup time < 3 seconds
- WebView page load time < 5 seconds
- WASM code execution time < 100ms for simple operations
- Memory usage < 200MB during normal operation

### User Experience Metrics
- User satisfaction rating > 4.0/5.0
- Task completion rate > 90%
- Error rate < 1%
- Feature adoption rate > 70%
