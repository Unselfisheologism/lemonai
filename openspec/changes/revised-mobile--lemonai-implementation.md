üöÄ REVISED MOBILE LEMONAI IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
üìå Project Overview
Transforming LemonAI into a mobile-first workflow automation platform that works on Android using a fundamentally different approach than previously implemented.

üîë Critical Architecture Changes
‚úÖ NEW APPROACH (WASM + Accessibility Service):
Use Android Accessibility Service for UI automation (based on Blurr repository approach)
Pre-compile MCP pieces to WASM (NOT run full Node.js MCP server on mobile)
Implement simple WebView-based OAuth flow for service connections
NO Node.js runtime on mobile devices
NO Docker or complex containerization
Focus ONLY on Gmail and Notion pieces initially
‚ùå PREVIOUS APPROACH (DISCONTINUED):
Running Node.js MCP servers on mobile devices
nodejs-mobile integration
Complex build configurations
üß© New Implementation Strategy
1. WASM Pieces Implementation
Pre-compile @activepieces/piece-gmail and @activepieces/piece-notion to WASM
Create WasmPieces.js to manage compiled pieces
Store WASM modules in public/wasm/ directory
2. Android Accessibility Service
Implement native Android service based on Blurr repository approach
Create JavaScript bridge for communication between WebView and native layer
Implement automation steps execution through Accessibility Service
3. Simple OAuth Flow
Create WebView-based authentication flow
Store tokens securely using Android Keystore
Implement token refresh mechanism
üì± Mobile Implementation Plan
ANDROID NATIVE LAYER (Kotlin)
MainActivity with WebView integration
AndroidAutomationInterface for JavaScript communication
AutomationService extending AccessibilityService
Permission handling for accessibility service
JAVASCRIPT BRIDGE
AndroidAutomation.js for native communication
WasmPieces.js for WASM piece management
AuthFlow.js for OAuth implementation
WEBVIEW UI
Simple interface for connecting services
Workflow creation and execution UI
Status and error reporting
üì¶ Deliverables Checklist
 Android native layer with Accessibility Service implementation
 JavaScript bridge for Android automation
 WASM pieces implementation for Gmail and Notion
 Simple OAuth flow for service connections
 Basic UI for connecting services
 Documentation for building and testing
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
DO NOT MODIFY any existing Gradle files or Android build configurations
DO NOT implement Node.js runtime on mobile
DO NOT use Docker or complex containerization
Focus on simplicity for non-technical users
